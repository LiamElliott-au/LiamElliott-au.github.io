    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>A colleague and I recently finished a short 3-week project with a client, the result of which is one very happy client, and an MVP finished before the deadline. Below are the lessons that I learnt during that project.</p>
<h3 id="success">Success</h3>
<p>First, let me define success in this situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Completing the Minimum Viable Product feature set within the strict budget constraints set by the client.</li>
<li>A product the end-user can easily use</li>
<li>Intuitive integration points that just work</li>
<li>A <strong>Happy</strong> client</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I for one was extremely surprised with the result, as going into it I still wasn’t 100% sure what the final implementation would look like, and even though the estimates from the spec review suggested it would be possible, I was still worried.</p>
<p>From an architectural and technology point of view, there wasn’t anything tricky, this was a standard UI and API. Given our tight time constraints, and also the great feedback from Jason Taylor&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lwCVE_XgqI">Clean Architecture video</a>, this was where we started. <a href="https://github.com/JasonGT/NorthwindTraders">https://github.com/JasonGT/NorthwindTraders</a>. This is a well laid out and easy to understand implementation of the clean architecture pattern.</p>
<h2 id="dont-start-from-scratch">DON’T Start from scratch</h2>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/jasongtau">Jason</a> for the hard work, I was expecting to spend days or more on building a base framework, but having this reference meant it was pretty much done within the first day. However simply cutting and pasting the code isn’t enough, being familiar with how and why it works is even more important, especially the Nswag integration as it isn’t obvious to start with. If you are unsure, I’m happy to answer questions, as I assume Jason would be too. This also goes for the UI, Leveraging past projects to have a basic UI template, Angular (No Ngrx on this one) + FlexLayout + Angular material + Nswag also helped with lesson 2 below. Note: Starring Jason’s Repo, and publicly acknowledging/thanking him (eg twitter) is not only a nice thing to do, but it also helps Jason realise the positive impact he has on our community. This goes for all resources you find helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Use (and understand) a reference architecture, don’t waste time starting from scratch. If one doesn’t exist CREATE One just as Jason did</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 1a:</strong> If you do use someone’s reference, acknowledge them and thank them, let them know how it helped, it’s easy to do, it’s free, and it’s the nice thing to do. Preferably publicly, so their hard work gets noticed, otherwise privately at the very least, so they know they have helped out in some way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-the-ui-up-and-running-before-the-first-demo-and-validate-early">Get the UI up and running before the first demo, and validate early</h2>
<p>As the project was moving along at a rapid pace, and we were also aware of the limited time/budget for the project, we made a point of ensuring there was some form of UI available for our first sprint demo, to ensure the UI was on the right path, and to ensure the client felt like there was progress.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Validate your UI design with the Product Owner as soon as you have something to show, and make sure you can demo at first sprint review</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dont-underestimate-the-bureaucratic-processes-of-large-enterprises">Don’t underestimate the Bureaucratic processes of large enterprises</h2>
<p>As much as we put an emphasis on getting DevOps up and running within the first sprint, We (well I) severely underestimated the complexity involved in getting environments set up in a large bureaucratic enterprise, it wasn’t until the second last day before we eventually got an automated deployment to a staging environment. We decided to finish up early, to save some time up our sleeve, to allow for user testing, before going live.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> When dealing with a large organisation try to get someone from the infrastructure/provisioning team allocated to your project in the early days, to get the environments up and running as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 3a:</strong> Have a backup plan, If needed use your free Azure credits, so the client can test early.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>We were fortunate enough to have good access to the Product Owner and the Domain experts that we needed to integrate with. The discussions we had between Us and the PO (non-technical); Us and Integration team (Technical) and even between ourselves, resulted in catching incorrect assumptions before they became difficult to rectify, or helped clarify (and alleviate) some concerns the Product Owner may have had, and also meant that our integrations went very smoothly even though we had limited opportunity to test this early.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> Communicate with EVERYONE more than you think is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 4a:</strong> Spend time educating a Non-Technical Product Owner as to the “WHY” things are implemented the way they are, don’t get bogged in the “HOW”. The client mentioned their appreciation of this on more than one occasion</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 4b:</strong> Technical resources from the client may not be as experienced, the time spent educating them on the “HOW” and the “WHY” will help maximise the likelihood of successful integrations</li>
<li><strong>Lesson 4c:</strong> Technical conversations/discussions/arguments, whiteboarding amongst the technical team is invaluable, and only benefit the project</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Of all of these lessons, I cannot understate that <strong>4a, Taking the time to explain and discuss with the Product Owner</strong> your decisions in a non-technical manner was by far, the most valuable lesson, and resulting in a client that was extremely happy throughout the process, so much so, that there is already talk of a follow up project orders of magnitude larger than this.</p>
<p>Even though the timeframes and the environment provided us with our fair share of challenges and stresses (don&rsquo;t they all), hitting all of our milestones and working so closely with the client helped ensure that this was not only a successful project, but we had fun along the way. Best of all, I learnt plenty, especially the non-technical stuff.</p><ul class="pa0">
